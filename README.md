Beta for individual stocks is determined using CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model). The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks.

Beta: The beta value for the stock market will always be 1; thus, stocks that tend to rise and fall with the stock market will also have a beta close to 1. Betas greater than 1 indicate that the stock is more volatile than the market, and betas less than 1 indicate that the stock is less volatile than the stock market. For instance, if a stock has a beta of 1.4, it has 40 per cent more volatility than the market, and if a stock has a beta of 0.4, it is 60 per cent less volatile than the market.

A single linear regression was used to estimate CAPM. The dependent variable is the total excess return for the stock and the independent variable is the total excess return for the stock market (market index). For this case study, the FT350 index was used as the market index, and an estimated regression equation will be developed using monthly data. The data contained in the Excel file provides the accumulated stock price (i.e., capital appreciation plus dividends) for two widely traded common stocks in the London Stock Exchange and the FT350 index.
